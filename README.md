# Good First Issue
A CLI for finding issues labeled with "good-first-issue" to _hopefully_ lower the barrier to contributing to open source projects.

## Usage

### As CLI

Via npx:
```
npx good-first-issue <project>
```

> If project is omitted (e.g. `npx good-first-issue`), a project selector will be presented, allowing you to select from the list of available projects.

As a global module:
```
npm i -g good-first-issue
good-first-issue <project>
```

#### Options

- `-o, --open` - open in browser
- `-f, --first` - Return first/top issue

### As Module

```js
const goodFirstIssue = require('good-first-issue')

// project should be from the below projects table
await goodFirstIssue(project, options)
```

#### Options

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sort` | `string` | Allowed values: `comments`, `created`, `updated` |
| `order` | `string` | Allowed values: `asc`, `desc` |

## TODOs: What's coming up next
`good-first-issue` is still in an early state. I wanted to get `good-first-issue node` out the door, but have some other things I'm planning on implementing. Here's a list:

- [x] `good-first-issue node` command
- [x] Interactive selector when `good-first-issue` is run without a sub command
- [ ] Export good first issues for all repos that have a command
- [ ] Add tests

If you'd like to help with any of these, feel free to submit a PR or ask how you can help ðŸ¤—

## Adding New Projects
If you'd like to add a new project to `good-first-issue`, you're more than welcome to submit a PR! There are a few components you'll need to submit:

- Update `data/projects.json`
  - Add your `<project>` as a property of `projects` with an object that includes a `name`, `description`, and a `q` (representing the GitHub search query).

- Update `README.md`
  - Add your `<project>` at the bottom of the [Projects](#projects) table above with `name` and `project`

### Adding New Projects: More Information

You can pull your queries directly from a standard GitHub search! If you want to build something a bit more complex, you can use the advanced search tool if you want to build more specific custom queries: https://github.com/search/advanced

As a CLI, `good-first-issue` uses the Commander.js CLI framework. If you want to better understand how our CLI is built, commander.js is pretty [well documented](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/). Also used are Chalk for terminal coloring and [boxen](https://github.com/sindresorhus/boxen) to simplify the output container implementation.
